Macnancy
========

Macnancy is a small plugin for [Palantír](http://github.com/koraktor/palantir)

girlfriend or wife or whoever you want.
Macnancy shows the current week an day in your status bar and when you click on
Macnancy's status item you can see the calculated delivery date and how many
days remain.
You can configure the date Macnancy uses in three different ways:

* The calculated delivery date
* The date of conception
* The date of the last period
